# ScaleIO Plugin for Fuel

## Overview

The `ScaleIO` plugin allows to:
  * Deploy an EMC ScaleIO v.2.0 cluster together with OpenStack and configure OpenStack to use ScaleIO
    as the storage for persistent and ephemeral volumes
  * Configure OpenStack to use an existing ScaleIO cluster as a volume backend
  * Support the following ScaleIO custer modes: 1_node, 3_node and 5_node
    the mode is chosen automatically depending on the number of controller nodes


## Requirements

| Requirement                      | Version/Comment |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Mirantis OpenStack               | 6.1             |
| Mirantis OpenStack               | 7.0             |

## Recommendations

1. Use configuration with 3 controllers or 5 controllers.
    Although 1 controller mode is supported is suitable for testing purposees only.
2. Assign Cinder role for all controllers with allocating minimal diskspace for this role.
    Some space is needed because of FUEL6.1/7.0 framework limitation (this space will not used).
    Rest of the space keep for images.
3.  Use nodes with similar HW configuration within one group of roles.
4. Deploy SDS coponents only on compute nodes.
    Deploymen SDS-es on controllers is supported but it is more suitable for testing than for production environment.
5. On compute nodes keep minimal space for virtual storage on the first disk, rest disks use for ScaleIO.
    Some space is needed because of FUEL6.1/7.0 framework limitations.
    Other disks should be unallocated and can be used for ScaleIO.
6. In case of extending cluster with new compute nodes not to forget to run update_hosts tasks on controller nodes via FUEL cli. 

## Limitations

1. Plugin is only compatible with Mirantis 6.1 and 7.0.
2. Plugin supports the only Ubuntu environment.
3. The only hyper converged environment is supported - there is no separate ScaleIO Storage nodes.
4. Multi storage backend is not supported.
5. It is not possible to use different backends for persistent and ephemeral volumes.
6. Disks for SDS-es should be unallocated before deployment via FUEL UI or cli.
7. MDMs and Gateways are deployed together and only onto controller nodes.
8. There is no ability to split data network traffic from replication traffic.
9. There is no fault sets support.
10. Adding and removing node(s) to/from the OpenStack cluster won't re-configure the ScaleIO.
     This is a limitation of the Fuel Plugin Framework which doesn't trigger task when those actions are performed.
     One exception here is new SDC compupents are registered in ScaleIO automatically.
     Registering other components is possible either by running the task 'update_hosts' on controllers (via FUEL cli)
     or by adding component into ScaleIO cluster via ScaleIO cli (scli) that available on controller nodes.
     For removal nodes it is needed to remove nodes from ScaleIO via ScaleIO cli (scli).

# Installation Guide

## ScaleIO Plugin install from source code

To install the ScaleIO Plugin from source code, you first need to prepare an environment to build the RPM file of the plugin. The recommended approach is to build the RPM file directly onto the Fuel Master node so that you won't have to copy that file later.

Prepare an environment for building the plugin on the **Fuel Master node**.

1. Install the standard Linux development tools:
    ```
    $ yum install createrepo rpm rpm-build dpkg-devel git
    ```

2. Install the Fuel Plugin Builder. To do that, you should first get pip:
    ```
    $ easy_install pip
    ```

3. Then install the Fuel Plugin Builder (the `fpb` command line) with `pip`:
    ```
    $ pip install fuel-plugin-builder
    ```

*Note: You may also have to build the Fuel Plugin Builder if the package version of the
plugin is higher than package version supported by the Fuel Plugin Builder you get from `pypi`.
In this case, please refer to the section "Preparing an environment for plugin development"
of the [Fuel Plugins wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins) if you
need further instructions about how to build the Fuel Plugin Builder.*

4. Clone the ScaleIO Plugin git repository (note the `--recursive` option):
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudscaling/fuel-plugin-scaleio.git
    $ cd fuel-plugin-scaleio
    ```

5. Check that the plugin is valid:
    ```
    $ fpb --check .
    ```

6. Build the plugin:
    ```
    $ fpb --build .
    ```

7. Install plugin:
    ```
    $ fuel plugins --install ./scaleio-2.0-2.0-1.noarch.rpm
    ```
